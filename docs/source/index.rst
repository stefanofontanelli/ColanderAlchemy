ColanderAlchemy
===============

`ColanderAlchemy` helps you to automatically generate
`Colander <https://github.com/Pylons/colander>`_ 
schemas based on `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ mapped classes.

Quick start
-----------

In order to get started with `ColanderAlchemy`, you can either use
:meth:`colanderalchemy.setup_schema` to automatically create and attach a
schema to a mapped class for you, or else you can use
:class:`colanderalchemy.SQLAlchemySchemaNode` to have more control over the
auto-generated schema.

The easiest way to get going is to set up an SQLAlchemy event listener.
The :meth:`colanderalchemy.setup_schema` method is designed to be attached to
the ``mapper_configured`` event:

.. code-block:: python

    from sqlalchemy import event
    from colanderalchemy import setup_schema
    event.listen(mapper, 'mapper_configured', setup_schema)

Now, once you configure any mapped class, you'll automatically get a mapped
Colander schema on the class as the attribute ``__colanderalchemy__``.
Keep in mind that you should configure the event listener as soon as possible
in your application, especially if you're using `declarative
<http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/orm/extensions/declarative.html>`_
definitions.

By associating ``ColanderAlchemy`` configuration with your mapped class,
its columns, and its relationships, you can tell ``ColanderAlchemy``
how to generate each and every part of your mapped schema - including things
like titles, descriptions, preparers, validators, widgets, and more. 

Check out :ref:`info_argument` for more information on how.

Usage
-----

Beyond the event listener methodology above, you can use
:meth:`colanderalchemy.setup_schema` manually.  Simply pass it a SQLAlchemy
mapped class like so:

.. code-block:: python

   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Text
   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
   from colanderalchemy import setup_schema
   
   Base = declarative_base()

   class SomeClass(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'some_table'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
       name =  Column(String(50))
       biography =  Column(Text())

   setup_schema(None, SomeClass)
   SomeClass.__colanderalchemy__ #A Colander schema for you to use

If you already have a mapped class available, you can just pass it as is - you
don't need to redefine another schema. 

Also, if you'd like even more control over your generated schema, then
use :class:`colanderalchemy.SQLAlchemySchemaNode` directly like so:

.. code-block:: python

    from colanderalchemy import SQLAlchemySchemaNode
    from my.project import SomeClass

    schema = SQLAlchemySchemaNode(SomeClass,
                                  includes=['name', 'biography'],
                                  excludes=['id'],
                                  title='Some class') 

Note the various arguments you can pass when creating your mapped schema -
you have full control over how the schema is generated and what fields
are included, which are excluded, and more. See the
:class:`colanderalchemy.SQLAlchemySchemaNode` API documentation for more
information. For more information you should read the section :ref:`examples`
to see how use `ColanderAlchemy`.

In either situation, you can now pass the resulting ``Colander`` schema to
anything that needs it.  For instance, this works well with ``Deform`` and you
can read more about this later in this documentation: :ref:`deform`.

How it works
------------

`ColanderAlchemy` auto-generates `Colander` schemas following these rules:

    1) The type of the schema is ``colander.MappingSchema``,

    2) The schema has a ``colander.SchemaNode`` for each ``sqlalchemy.Column``
       in the mapped object:

        * The type of ``colander.SchemaNode`` 
          is based on the type of ``sqlalchemy.Column``
        * The ``colander.SchemaNode`` use ``validator=colander.OneOf``
          when the type of ``sqlalchemy.Column`` is ``sqlalchemy.types.Enum``
        * ``colander.SchemaNode`` has ``missing=None`` 
          when the ``sqlalchemy.Column`` has ``nullable=True``
        * ``colander.SchemaNode`` has ``missing=colander.required`` 
          when the ``sqlalchemy.Column`` has ``nullable=False`` or 
          ``primary_key=True``
        * ``colander.SchemaNode`` has ``missing=VALUE`` and ``default=VALUE`` 
          when the ``sqlalchemy.Column`` has ``default=VALUE`` (*Note: a 
          callable default will only be called _once_ when generating the 
          schema*)

    3) The schema has a ``colander.SchemaNode`` for each `relationship`
       (``sqlalchemy.orm.relationship`` or those from
       ``sqlalchemy.orm.backref``) in the mapped object:

        * The ``colander.SchemaNode`` has ``missing=None``
        * The type of ``colander.SchemaNode`` is:
            * A ``colander.Mapping`` for `ManyToOne and OneToOne
              relationships`
            * A ``colander.Sequence`` of ``colander.Mapping`` for `ManyToMany
              and OneToMany relationships`

        For both kind of relationships, the ``colander.Mapping`` is built using
        `rule 2` on the mapped class referenced by relationship.

Read the section :ref:`customization` to see how change these rules and how to
customize the Colander schema returned by ColanderAlchemy.
